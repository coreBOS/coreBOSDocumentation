Basic Query Language
--------------------

Since coreBOS is a complete business application it needed a more
powerful service to retrieve information than the standard REST protocol
could offer, something closer to a GraphQL interface (we didn't have
GraphQL back then). To cover this need, a hybrid SQL language was
created VQL (Vtigercrm Query Language). This language is a reduced
subset of the standard SQL language with extensions to "understand" the
business entities contained in each coreBOS. The limitations are:

-   subqueries are not supported
-   no mathematical aggregation functions are supported except count(\*)
-   we can only execute queries against entities, not direct database
    tables and once we consult an entity we have access to all its
    fields no matter how many tables it is separated into in the
    database application. There are some special entities due to their
    non-standard internal structure:
    -   **Currency**: we can execute queries against defined currencies
        in the application
    -   **Groups**: we can get a list of defined groups
    -   **DocumentFolders**: we can get a list of document folders
        created
    -   **LoginHistory**: historic access data
    -   **AuditTrail**: operational data for all users
    -   **Workflow**: list the workflows in the application
    -   **ModTracker**: field-level changes on records
-   the result set is restricted to 100 records by default. You can
    overcome this limit by specifically setting a limit clause and by
    paging the result set (recommended).

Even with these limitations, it is an incredible and powerful language.

The accepted format definition is:

    select [distinct] * | <column_list> | <count(*)>
    from <object>
    [where <conditionals>] 
    [order by <column_list>] [limit [<m>, ]<n>];

-   column\_list: comma-separated list of field names
-   object: module name
-   conditionals: condition operations, in clauses, or like clauses
    separated by 'and' or 'or' operands these are processed from left to
    right
    -   conditional operators: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, =, !=
    -   in clauses: &lt;column name&gt; in (&lt;value list&gt;)
        -   value list: a comma-separated list of values
    -   like clauses: &lt;column name&gt; like '&lt;value pattern&gt;'
-   the column list in the order by clause can have at most two column
    names.
-   m, n: integer values to specify the offset and limit respectively.
    If only one value is given it is applied as limit

![](coreboswebservicequery.png?width=100%)

Try these VQL commands.

    select * from contacts
    select firstname,contact_no,phone from contacts
    select firstname,contact_no,phone from contacts order by firstname
    select count(*) from contacts
    /* Only four records starting from the first */
    select firstname,contact_no,phone from contacts order by firstname limit 4
    /* Only four records starting from the third */
    select firstname,contact_no,phone from contacts order by firstname limit 3, 4
    select * from groups
    select * from workflow
    select * from invoice where hdnGrandTotal > 5000
    select * from invoice where hdnGrandTotal > 5000 and invoicestatus = 'Created'
    select * from invoice where hdnGrandTotal > 5000 and invoicestatus like '%Created%'

There are **four different syntaxes** supported.

One is **the original query language** inherited from vtiger CRM. This
is rather limited as it doesn't support related entities nor parenthesis
in the conditions.

So we made a first enhancement based on **the
[getRelatedRecords](../06.getrelatedcontrols) work**. This
second syntax was created before we started the coreBOS project and was
added as a base feature when it was born. You can read about this second
syntax below and see it in use in our [Customer Portal Extension]( /en/extensions/coreboscp).

Finally, we enhanced the syntax a third time based on the work done in
**the QueryGenerator class** which gives us a rich and flexible syntax
with support for related modules and advanced conditions.

The problem is that in order to maintain backward compatibility we have
kept all the syntaxes together and detect dynamically which one to use
for each query. This is a bit misleading sometimes.

When a query is sent to the webservice query API it looks for the string
"related.", if this string is found we apply the [Related Entity Query Syntax](../09.querylanguage/item.md#related-entity-query-syntax),
if the string is not found we look for "not in", "not null", "." or "(".
None of these strings are supported by the query syntax inherited from
vtiger CRM so we apply the Extended QueryGenerator syntax. Finally, we
apply the original VQL syntax.

<div class="notices red">
So, be careful when sending a
query as it can easily be sent to the syntax parser you don't expect.
</div>
Let's go over that again.

-   All queries use the list type module name in the FROM and WHERE
    sections
-   [Related Entity Query Syntax](../09.querylanguage/item.md#related-entity-query-syntax)
    is based on the getRelatedRecords web service endpoint, so anything
    you can do with the query language can be done with this endpoint.
    The reverse is not true as the getRelatedRecords method has some
    functionality that cannot be accessed through the query language.
    This query language functionality is deprecated and not recommended,
    it works, and will continue to do so, but the QueryGenerator syntax
    is more powerful and the recommended way to get information from the
    query language.
-   Given a web service query, the detection of what parser to use
    follows these steps:

#### 1.- Related modules

When a query is sent to the web service query API it looks for the
string "related."

If this string is found we apply the Related Entity Query Syntax.
```xml

    select * from projecttask where related.project=30x144
    select * from projecttask where related.project=30x144 and projecttaskname='dsf'
    select * from documents where related.accounts=3x12
    select * from documents where filelocationtype='E' and related.contacts=4x22
    select * from Documents where (related.Contacts='4x22') AND (filelocationtype LIKE '%I%') LIMIT 5;
    select * from modcomments where related.helpdesk=9x114
    select * from modcomments where related.helpdesk=9x114 and commentcontent like 'hdcc%'
    select * from products where related.products=6x58 // only product children are accessible with this syntax
    select * from products where related.contacts=4x22 // only directly related products
    select * from products where related.contacts=4x22 and productcategory='Software' // only directly related products
    select * from Products where related.Contacts='4x22' LIMIT 5;
    select * from Products where related.Contacts='4x22' order by productname LIMIT 5;
```
#### 2.- Extended syntax - not related

If the string 'related' is not found we look for "not in", "not null",
"." or "(".

None of these strings are supported by the query syntax inherited from
vtiger CRM so we apply the Extended QueryGenerator syntax.

    SELECT projectname,modifiedtime
    FROM project
    where projectname like '%cap%' and (modifiedtime>'2016-06-30 19:11:59' or modifiedtime<'2016-07-30 19:11:59')

    SELECT *
    FROM project
    where projectname like '%cap%' and (modifiedtime>'2016-06-30 19:11:59' or modifiedtime<'2016-07-30 19:11:59')

#### 3.- Use legacy VQL

Query to more than one module (joins)
-------------------------------------

There are no "joins" in WebService Query Language, but coreBOS will do
them for you. Remember that coreBOS WebService Query Language talks
about entities, not tables.

We do *select...from accounts* not *select...from vtiger\_accounts*

In this same line, you have to specify fields prefixed by their module
name and WSQL will do whatever it has to do to get the field from the
directly related module. For example

    select firstname, Accounts.accountname from Contacts;

Note, that fields on the module **DO NOT** have a prefix. The result of
this query is VERY different:

    select Contacts.firstname, Accounts.accountname from Contacts;

In this second query, we are accessing the first name of the Contact
RELATED to the contacts. The Contact module has a related field to
itself (Reports To), the column in the query above is retrieving the
name from the RELATED contact through the Reports To field, not the name
on the contact record itself.

So, if you want fields from a related module, just ask for them

#### Examples

    SELECT * FROM Products where productname='sample' LIMIT 10;

    select projectname,modifiedtime
    from project
    where projectname like '%o%' and modifiedtime>'2016-06-30 19:11:59'

which will be sent to the original query parser, but we can also send it
like this

    select projectname,modifiedtime
    from project
    where (projectname like '%o%' and modifiedtime>'2016-06-30 19:11:59')

which would be parsed by the QueryGenerator class. In this example, both
should return the same set of values, but in this example, things are
very different:

    select projectname,modifiedtime
    from project
    where projectname like '%cap%' and modifiedtime>'2016-06-30 19:11:59' or modifiedtime<'2016-07-30 19:11:59'

    select projectname,modifiedtime
    from project
    where projectname like '%cap%' and (modifiedtime>'2016-06-30 19:11:59' or modifiedtime<'2016-07-30 19:11:59')

returning a completely different set as the original query parser
evaluates the conditions in order of appearance with no parenthesis.

Besides the enhanced syntax, there are **two very important things to
note** about this dynamic switch.

**One** is that the original query parser and QueryGenerator parser use
different ways of identifying a related record. The original parser uses
the web service ID while the QueryGenerator uses the record's entity
field name. In other words, when adding conditions on related fields
(uitype10), the original parser expects the CRMID of the related record
while the QueryGenerator parser expects the value of the entity link
field.

For example, this query:

    select projecttaskname,projectid,modifiedtime
    from ProjectTask
    where projectid='33x6772' and  modifiedtime>'2015-08-12 10:10:48' and modifiedtime<'2015-09-12 10:10:48'

looks like this:

![](wsvqlrelfieldreference01.png?width=100%)

but if we add parenthesis and launch the query we get no results
returned.

    select projecttaskname,projectid,modifiedtime
    from ProjectTask
    where (projectid='33x6772' and  modifiedtime>'2015-08-12 10:10:48' and modifiedtime<'2015-09-12 10:10:48')

with the parenthesis, we are using the QueryGenerator parser and must
set the projectid field to the entity link field which is project name.
The correct query looks like this:

    select projecttaskname,projectid,modifiedtime
    from ProjectTask
    where (projectid='Owen' and  modifiedtime>'2015-08-12 10:10:48' and modifiedtime<'2015-09-12 10:10:48')

![](wsvqlrelfieldreference02.png?width=100%)

Optionally, we can search directly on the project ID with the extended
QueryGenerator syntax:

    select projecttaskname,projectid,modifiedtime
    from ProjectTask
    where (Project.id='33x6772' and  modifiedtime>'2015-08-12 10:10:48' and modifiedtime<'2015-09-12 10:10:48')

The **second** is that the original query parser will automatically add
the "limit 100" to the query while the QueryGenerator will not do this.

You can find a whole set of examples in the [coreBOS Web Service Developer Tool](../02.coreboswsbrowser) and the
[webservice query unit tests suite](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSTests/blob/master/include/Webservices/VtigerModuleOperation_QueryTest.php).

Query return limit
------------------

The select statement only returns 100 records. This is due to timeout
and resource restrictions. If you want to obtain more records you must
use the *limit* modifier. Any select statement with a limit modifier
will try to return all the records indicated in the limit. So, if we
have a contacts table with 150 records, this query:

    select * from contacts;

will return 100 records, while this query:

    select * from contacts limit 200;

will return the 150 records.

    select firstname,contact_no,phone from contacts order by firstname limit 4;

Only four records starting from the first

    select firstname,contact_no,phone from contacts order by firstname limit 3, 4

Only four records starting from the third

Related Entity Query Syntax
---------------------------

[plugin:youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B0A6IPMnJM)
Constructing on top of the
[getRelatedRecords](../06.getrelatedcontrols) function we
have extended the REST query syntax to benefit from that functionality,
making it easy to query related entities and filter them also.

The new syntax enhances the *where* conditional statement to support
module names preceded with the "*related*" string and followed by the id
of the entity:

    where related.modulename=id

Examples:

    select * from projecttask where related.project=30x144
    select * from projecttask where related.project=30x144 and projecttaskname='dsf'
    select * from documents where related.accounts=3x12
    select * from documents where filelocationtype='E' and related.contacts=4x22
    Select * from Documents where (related.Contacts='4x22') AND (filelocationtype LIKE '%I%') LIMIT 5;
    select * from modcomments where related.helpdesk=9x114
    select * from modcomments where related.helpdesk=9x114 and commentcontent like 'hdcc%'
    select * from products where related.products=6x58 // only product children are accessible with this syntax
    select * from products where related.contacts=4x22  // only directly related products
    select * from products where related.contacts=4x22 and productcategory='Software'  // only directly related products
    Select * from Products where related.Contacts='4x22' LIMIT 5;
    Select * from Products where related.Contacts='4x22' order by productname LIMIT 5;

-   queryparameters support *limit* and *offset* for those sets of
    related records where the total count is very high or simply high
    enough to want to be able to page through.
-   queryparameters support column definitions, reducing the size of
    information being returned
-   **multiple entities, IDs or related modules** are **NOT** supported
    with this API. We have created the extended query language
    functionality, based on Query Generator for this.

There are a few restrictions we couldn't overcome:

-   only one related entity may be used, as the getRelatedRecords
    function works with only one entity ID, we inherit this restriction.
    If more than one is put in the query, only the first is used and the
    rest are ignored and eliminated.
-   the product relation is limited to directly related records, which
    means that on a contact we will only have access to the ones on his
    +info tab, or for a product we can only see it's bundle child
    products.
-   advanced filtering (limited by current query syntax)

<div class="notices blue">
 The Webservice extended query
language functionality, based on Query GeneratorQuery overcomes some of
these limitations.</div>

Searching for empty relations
-----------------------------

When you have a web service query, and you want to select records from a
module where a certain related (UI10) field is empty use:

    select * from PurchaseOrder where po_related_soid = 15x0 

Where 15 is the web service ID for the module of the UI10 field (in this
case SalesOrder). Then use the 'x', and add a 0.

'po\_related\_soid' is a placeholder for the fieldname you want to check
on, replace that with your own. Of course, also replace the module name
with your own.

[Thanks Luke!](https://discussions.corebos.org/showthread.php?tid=912)

Errors that can be returned
---------------------------

Besides errors that may be returned by the underlying code this function
uses, it can return directly these errors:

-   **INVALID\_MODULE**: Given module (module) cannot be found, which
    one will be specified in the message.
-   **ACCESSDENIED**: Permission to perform the operation on module
    (module) is denied. The current user cannot work with one of the
    modules
-   **INVALIDID**: Id specified is incorrect. The given ID does not
    correspond to an entity in the application.
-   **ACCESSDENIED**: Permission to read given object is denied. The
    current user does not have read access to the records.
-   **RECORDNOTFOUND**: The record you are trying to access is not
    found. The given ID is pointing to a deleted record or is incorrect.

Connecting to the web service API with Postman
----------------------------------------------

Using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to access the coreBOS Web
service API is rather easy. The main trick to keep in mind is that GET
requests parameters go in the PARAMS tab and POST requests parameters go
in the BODY tab.

The [Login is a two-step process](../07.login) so we have
to create two requests and manually calculate the access token MD5.
