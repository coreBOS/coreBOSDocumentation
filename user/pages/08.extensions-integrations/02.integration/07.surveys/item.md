The survey integration system in **coreBOSCRM** is based on the idea of
joining forces. We don't pretend to have a complete survey management
system inside the application and compete with existing tools dedicated
to this purpose, because we know we will never reach the level of
quality and professionalism that companies which are fully dedicated to
this can achieve. Our goal is to to what we do best: **manage your
information**.

With this in mind we have created four modules which permit us to
control the set of surveys that we launch and the answers to these
surveys that our clients fill in. So you will be able to match the
answers with your clients, and even more important, you will be able to
use all the process automation tools that you have in **coreBOSCRM** to
react to these answers in near real time making it easy to add a contact
to a drip campaign or a segmentation list or even create calendar events
depending on their answers.

There are four new modules which can be found in the "**Analysis**"
menu:

On one hand we have: **surveys and questions**, which represent the
exact survey and the questions that it contains. These modules simply
contain a copy of the information created in the external survey program
chosen. They do not create the survey in the external system, they
simply record the fact that a survey was created and the questions it
contained. The records in this module are autocreated when the first
survey arrives.

On the other hand we have the modules **survey done and answers**, these
modules record the fact of a given client filling in and sending a
survey and the exact answers he has given. The records in this module
are autocreated as the surveys are submitted.

When the records are created all associated workflows are called so we
can tie in with all the process automation tasks that the workflow
system brings to the application.

Just to throw around some ideas, we could associate a workflow to the
creation event of a survey done and send a "*thank you*" email to the
client and at the same time put them into a segmentation list, we could
monitor specific answers to some questions in order to put the client on
some campaign or tag them with some label for future segmenting or send
them a loyalty discount,... the possibilities and combinations are
enormous.

Obviously with all this information being injected directly into our
production system simple things like creating a report to know how many
people completed a given survey is a trivial task, directly supported by
the application.

If you need more information you can see this video tutorial FIXME where
we show how to do it with [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com/) or [ask
