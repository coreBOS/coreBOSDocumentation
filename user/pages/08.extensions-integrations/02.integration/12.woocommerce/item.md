This integration supports a two-way synchronization of products and
customers between the two applications and a one-way synchronization of
orders from the WordPress website to your coreBOS. So we will be able to
automatically receive all our website orders inside coreBOS where we can
manage them in our business logic while triggering all our workflows and
business processes.

Once configured the integration just works transparently in the
background.

The configuration has two parts, one in coreBOS and the other in
WooCommerce.

**In WooCommerce**

1.  go to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; REST API
    ![](woocommercerestapi1.png?width=100%)

2.  set a name for the access
3.  select a user (admin)
4.  give Read/Write permission
5.  click next to see the consumer key and secret. Copy these values as
    you will need to give them to coreBOS
6.  select the "webhooks" option (next to REST API)
   ![](woocommercenot.png?width=90%)

7.  add new web hooks for
    1.  Product Create, Update, Delete and Restore
    2.  Customer Create, Update, Delete and Restore
    3.  Order Create, Update, Delete and Restore
8.  give them names and make them Active
9.  set the URL to
    ```php
    https://your_corebos_server/your_corebos/notifications.php?type=wcintegration
    ```
10. define a strong secret and copy it to save it in coreBOS later
11. use the latest API version (3 minimum)
12. now activate and define the taxes for your website

**In coreBOS**

1.  go to the Integrations page in Utilities
    ```php
    https://your_corebos_server/your_corebos/index.php?module=Utilities&action=index
    ```
2.  Click on the WooCommerce section
    ![](cbwoocommerceconfig.png?width=100%)

3.  set the consumer key, the consumer secret, and the notifications
    secret which you set in WooCommerce
4.  set the WordPress URL
5.  select the default modules we will sync with. WooCommerce has three
    entities: Products, Customers, and Orders. In coreBOS, we can map
    Customers to Accounts or Contacts, Products to Products or Services,
    and Orders to SalesOrders or Invoices. You must define the modules
    you want to work with by default. Despite this selection, you can
    still synchronize the other modules for Customers and Products.
6.  finally, you have to activate the message queue processor which is
    done in the operating system with the command
    ```php 
    php include//cbmqtm/run.php
    ``` 
    you have to make sure this process is
    running continuously for the integration to work

Here you have a video presentation of the steps and the functionality.

These are the two maps I used for testing:

**WC2Products**

```php
    <map>
      <originmodule>
        <originname>woocommerce</originname>
      </originmodule>
      <targetmodule>
        <targetname>Products</targetname>
      </targetmodule>
      <fields>
        <field>
          <fieldname>productsheet</fieldname>
          <Orgfields>
            <Orgfield>
              <OrgfieldName>slug</OrgfieldName>
            </Orgfield>

        <field>

```

We have created a module named <strong>wcProductImage</strong> which is supported natively by this integration. It permits you to save images with meta information that will be sent to WooCommerce. Contact us if you are interested.

### Frequently Asked Questions


<strong> How can we send HTML descriptions to WooCommerce and back </strong>

In WooCommerce the description will be stored in the **wp\_posts** table
inside **post\_content** column. In general WordPress uses some filters
to encode and decode the value of **post\_content** before saving and
displaying it. You need to use Wordpress **wp\_insert\_post\_data** hook
to modify the passed value of **post\_content** before saving it to the
database.

You can modify that hook like this:

```php
    add_filter( 'wp_insert_post_data' , 'filter_post_data' , '99', 2 );

    function filter_post_data( $data , $postarr ) {
        // Change post content
        $data['post_content'] = html_entity_decode($data['post_content']);
        return $data;
    }
```


The goal is to save the raw data with html tags on the database. That
script can be added to your child theme’s **functions.php** file or via
a plugin that allows custom functions to be added.
